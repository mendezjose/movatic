## Introduction

This project is the backend and frontend of the Movatic Coding Challenge Project which consists of the follwing:

- A demo web application Gatsby/React.
- A web server Flask/Pyhton.

## Scenario

A large national bike-share operator wants to be able to view station data from bike-share systems from across the world. They want to do this by reading MDS / GBFS feeds.

- This is an example of a working MDS feed: https://gbfs.bcycle.com/bcycle_madison/gbfs.json
- You can use their station feed for this demo: https://gbfs.bcycle.com/bcycle_madison/station_status.json

The goal is to create a demo web application of this product to get customer buy-in.
Assume that this demo would be used as the foundation for a full implementation so it should be
developed to be easily extendable in the future.
